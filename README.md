# Advent Of Code 2023
These are my solutions to Advent of code in Rust.  
The solutions are in the `src/bin` directory.


To run a solution for a day simply run:
```bash
cargo r --bin DAY

# Example for day 1
cargo r --bin 01

```

To generate a template for a new day run:
```bash
./new DAY

#Example for day 1
./new 1
```
*NOTE*: You will need to create a `.env` file and put in it your advent of code session cookie.  
This is needed to download the input data.

```bash
# .env
export AOC_COOKIE="YOUR AOC COOKIE"
```
